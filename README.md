# DiscordWebhookIPUpdater
For those with remote hardware and dynamic IPs.... \

This uses api.ipify.org to get your IP address, then sends it to a Discord channel of your choosing using Discord's Webhook system. \

Create a Webhook in a Discord channel you have access to, enter your Webhook URL in the source and choose a random name, compile, then set a crontab to run every 30 minutes. Well, at least that's what I did.
